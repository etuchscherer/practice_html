<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Nicole Sprague, I'm 15 years old, and live in Illinois. I've grown up in Illinois all my life out in the country. Although I live in the country, I've never lived on an actual farm before. We don't have any animals or farm any fields. Below is a picture of what it'd look like to live where I live.</p>

<h2>What I plan on doing in the future.</h2>
<p>I see myself as an entrepreneur and I hope to build a company or be self-made by the age of 20.</p>
