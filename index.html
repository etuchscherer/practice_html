<p><strong>Here is a little history on how I got into shoes:</strong></p>
<p>When I was just a few weeks old, I started going to a daycare in my local town. I basically lived there for my whole life before I got into school. While there, I met my best friend, Rachel, now being 15 years old we are still best friends. One day as we were texting, she sent me a picture of her new Jordan's. They were the Son of Mars Low. I instantly fell in love with them, and decided to do some more research on shoes. Ever since then, I've been obsessed with shoes, I now own over 10 pairs of kicks in my collection. I hope to expand that collection in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Here is how I decided what I wanted to be in life--An Entrepeneur:</strong></p>
<p>When I learned more about the shoe community, I saw lots of business opportunities it that area. As I learned more about shoes, I would constantly see the word entrepreneur/enthusiast tied in with other sneakerheads' bios and such.</p>
